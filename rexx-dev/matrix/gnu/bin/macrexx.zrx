Conventions
To help you get the most from the text and keep track of what’s happening, we’ve used a number of con-
ventions throughout the book.
Boxes like this one hold important, not-to-be-forgotten information that is directly
relevant to the surrounding text.
Concerning styles in the text:
❑We italicize important words when we introduce them.
❑We show keyboard strokes like this: Ctrl-A.
❑We show filenames, URLs, variable names, and code within the text like this: my_file.txt.
❑We present code in two different ways:
In code examples we highlight new and important code with a gray background.
The gray highlighting is not used for code that’s less important in the present
context, or that has been shown before.
