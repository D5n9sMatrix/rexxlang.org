What You Need to Use This Book
You need nothing besides this book to get started. While this book is an “encyclopedia of Rexx,” its
examples were all run using freely downloadable Rexx interpreters, tools, and interfaces. The chapters
all tell you where to download any interpreters, tools, and interfaces the book demonstrates, as well as
how to set up and install them.The examples in this book were run and tested under Windows and/or
Linux, but you can work with this book with Rexx running any operating system you like
