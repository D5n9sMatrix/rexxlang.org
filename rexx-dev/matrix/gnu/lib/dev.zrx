/*
The Rexx language is not case-sensitive, so its instructions and functions can be encoded in uppercase,
lowercase, or mixed case. For example, the wordlength function can be encoded as wordlength,
WordLength, or WORDLENGTH. This book uses capitalization typical to the platforms for which its sample
scripts were written, but you can use any case you prefer.
Due to the typesetting software used in preparing this book, single quotation marks may appear as vertical,
forward-leaning, or backward-leaning. All are simply single quotation marks to Rexx. For example, these
two coding examples are exactly equivalent, even though the quote marks slant in different directions:
