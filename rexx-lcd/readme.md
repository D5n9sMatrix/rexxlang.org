If you’re new to Rexx, we recommend starting with Regina Rexx. Regina Rexx is a great place to start for
several reasons:
❑
Popularity — Regina is the most widely used free Rexx. Its large user community makes it easy
to get help on public forums. More interfaces and tools are tested with Regina than any other
Rexx implementation.
13Chapter 1
❑Runs anywhere — Rexx is a platform-independent language, and Regina proves the point. Regina
runs on almost any operating system including those in these families: Windows, Linux, Unix,
BSD, 32-bit DOS, Mac OS, and Symbian/EPOC32. It also runs on many important “second-tier”
systems, including BeOS, OpenVMS, OpenEdition, Amiga OS, AROS, AtheOS/Syllable, QNX
(QNX4/QNX6), OS/2, eCS, osFree, and other systems.
❑Meets all standards — Regina meets all Rexx standards including the TRL-2 and ANSI-1996
standards.
❑Documentation — Regina comes with complete documentation that precisely and fully explains
the product.
❑Open source — Regina is open source and distributed under the GNU Library General Public
License. Some Rexx interpreters are free but not open source, as shown in the preceding table.
The code examples in this book all conform to standard Rexx and were tested using Regina Rexx under
Windows and /or Linux. Run these scripts under any standard Rexx in any environment. A few scripts
require a specific operating system. For example, those in Chapter 14 illustrate how to issue operating
system commands and therefore are system-specific. Other scripts later in the book use specific open-
source interfaces, tools, or interpreters. Where we present examples that run only in certain environments,
we’ll point it out.
