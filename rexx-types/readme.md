## Introduction

Of all the free scripting languages, why should you learn Rexx? Rexx is unique in that it combines power
with ease of use. Long the dominant scripting language on mainframes, it is definitely a “power” language,
yet it is also so easy to use that its popularity has expanded to every conceivable platform. Today the vast
majority of Rexx developers use the language on Windows, Linux, Unix, and dozens of other systems . . .
and, there are nine free and open source Rexx interpreters available.
Here’s the Rexx story in a nutshell:
❑
Rexx runs on every platform under nearly every operating system.
So, your skills apply anywhere . . . and your code runs everywhere.
❑
Rexx enjoys a strong international standard that applies to every Rexx interpreter . . .
from handhelds to PCs to servers to mainframes.
❑Rexx is as easy as BASIC, yet about as powerful as Perl.
❑Rexx’s large user community means:
❑
❑Many free interpreters optimized for different needs and environments
❑A vast array of free interfaces and tools
❑Good support
Rexx comes in object-oriented versions as well as a version that is Java-compatible
(and even generates Java code!)
You may be wondering why ease of use is so important in a programming language—especially if you
are a high-end developer. First, understand that a truly “easy” language is easy to use, learn, remember,
maintain, and code. The benefits to beginners are obvious. With Rexx, you can start coding almost
immediately. There are no syntax tricks or language details to memorize before you begin. And, since
Rexx is also a powerful language, you can rest assured that you won’t run out of power as you learn and
grow in the language. Read the first few chapters in this book, and you’ll be scripting right away.
Continue reading, and you’ll mature into advanced scripting before you finish.
If you are a highly experienced developer, Rexx offers more subtle benefits. You will be wildly productive,
of course, as you free yourself from the shackles of syntax-driven code. More important is this: Simplicity
yields reliability. Your error rate will decline, and you’ll develop more reliable programs. This benefit is
greatest for the largest systems and the most complicated scripts. Your scripts will also live longer because
others will be able to understand, maintain, and enhance them. Your clever scriptlets and application mas-
terpieces won’t die of neglect if you leave the company and continue your career elsewhere.
Few easy languages are also powerful. Now, how does Rexx do that?Introduction
Rexx surrounds its small instruction with an extensive function library. Scripts leverage operating sys-
tem commands, external interfaces, programs, and functions. Rexx is a “glue” language that ties it all
together. Yet the language has few rules. Syntax is simple, minimal, flexible. Rexx doesn’t care about
uppercase or lowercase or formatting or spacing. Rexx scripts don’t use special symbols and contain no
punctuation.
Power does not require coding complexity!
If you’ve worked in the shell languages, you’ll breathe a sigh of relief that you’ve found a powerful lan-
guage in which you can program now and then without trying to recall arcane language rules. If you’ve
struggled with the syntax of languages such as Bash, Korn, Awk, or the C-shell, you’ll enjoy focusing on
your programming problem instead of linguistic peculiarities. And if you’ve ever had to maintain some-
one else’s Perl code, well . . . you might really be thankful for Rexx!
This book contains everything you need to know to get started with Rexx. How to freely download and
install the product. How to program in standard Rexx and object-oriented Rexx. How to program hand-
helds. How to program Windows, Linux, Unix, and mainframes. How to program in the Java environ-
ment in a Rexx-based language called NetRexx. How to script operating system commands, control Web
servers and databases and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) and
Apache and . . . you name it.
Everything you need is in this one book—it’s virtually a “Rexx encyclopedia.” It teaches standard Rexx
so that your skills apply to any platform—from handhelds to PCs and laptops to midrange servers run-
ning any operating system to mainframes. Yet it goes beyond the basics to cover interface programming
and advanced techniques. The book starts out easy, and is based on coding examples throughout to make
learning fast, simple, and fun. But it’s comprehensive enough to go the distance and cover advanced
scripting as well. And, you can freely download all the Rexx interpreters, tools, and interfaces it covers.
Welcome to the world of free Rexx !
